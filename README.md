# ExaAEC
ExaAEC is a multi-label Arabic emotion corpus that contains about 20,000 tweets classified as "neutral", "joy", "love", "anticipation", "acceptance", "surprise", "sadness", "fear", "anger" and "disgust". Each instance in the corpus contains the text and one or two most highlighted emotions that the writer wanted to express. 

The text is separated by comma (',') from labels.
